# Cancer-Prediction
This project builds a logistic regression model to predict breast cancer. The data is preprocessed, scaled, and split into training and test sets. The model achieves 97% accuracy and is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating strong performance in predicting malignant and benign cases.
